Code styling and static analysis tools.
Goal achieved

By the end of the exercise you will have adapted your code to a standard style that may make it more readable and usable by other developers.
Description

If you haven't done it already, create a virtual environment and install flake8 to run it against the entire basecode (including both the cli and tests directories).

Once you get the output, address each issue until the output of flake8 returns no error.

    In some exceptional cases you may want to use the #no-qa tag to skip a particular issue. This should only be done when you have no other alternative.

Once flake8 returns no issue, install isort and run it.

Then install the flake8 plugins pep8-naming and flake8-docstrings. Run flake8 again and fix the issues.

Finally, install and run black.
